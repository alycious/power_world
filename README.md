# Design Project using Power World Simulator
This project involved designing and evaluating transmission system upgrades for Island Electric Company (IEC) to integrate a new 600 MW wind farm into their 161/345 kV grid. Using PowerWorld Simulator, two distinct designs were developed, each incorporating different conductor types (Pheasant and Crow) and transmission line configurations to minimize power losses and ensure reliability under base-case and contingency conditions. Key considerations included conductor impedance, line distances, construction costs, and system losses over a 5-year period. Design 2 emerged as the optimal solution, balancing lower power losses, reduced line loading, and overall cost-effectiveness. The project demonstrates the application of power system analysis tools to address real-world grid integration challenges.
